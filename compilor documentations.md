# Detailed Explanation of a CASL II Two-Pass Assembler

This document provides a detailed walkthrough of a Python script that functions as a two-pass assembler for a subset of the CASL II assembly language. The goal of this assembler is to convert human-readable assembly code into machine-readable hexadecimal code.

## High-Level Overview

A **two-pass assembler** is a program that reads the source code twice to perform the translation. This approach solves the problem of "forward references," where an instruction refers to a label that is defined later in the code.

1.  **First Pass:** The primary goal of the first pass is to build a "Symbol Table." The assembler reads the code to find all user-defined labels (e.g., variables, loop entry points) and calculates their memory addresses. It does not generate the final machine code during this pass.

2.  **Second Pass:** In the second pass, the assembler has a complete symbol table with the addresses of all labels. It reads the code a second time, and now it can fully translate each instruction into its final hexadecimal machine code by substituting the label names with their known addresses from the symbol table.

## The `Compiler` Class

The entire logic is encapsulated within a `Compiler` class. This is a common object-oriented practice that keeps all related data (like the symbol table) and functions (the passes, the parser) neatly organized in one place.

```python
class Compiler:
    """
    A two-pass assembler for a subset of the CASL II language.
    This assembler builds a symbol table in the first pass and generates
    machine code in the second pass.
    """
```

### `__init__(self)` Method: The Setup

The `__init__` method is the constructor for the class. It runs automatically whenever a new `Compiler` object is created (e.g., `compiler = Compiler()`). Its job is to initialize all the variables and data structures the assembler will need for its operations.

```python
    def __init__(self):
        """Initializes the compiler's state."""
        self.symbol_table = {}
        self.intermediate_representation = []
        self.machine_code = []
        self.start_address = 0

        self.OPCODE_MAP = {
            'START': ('', 0), 'END':   ('', 0), 'DS': ('', 0), 'DC': ('', 1),
            'LD': ('10', 2), 'ST': ('11', 2), 'ADDA': ('30', 2),
            'JUMP': ('60', 2), 'RET': ('81', 1), 'NOP': ('00', 1)
        }

        self.instruction_handlers = {
            'LD': self._handle_format_r_adr, 'ST': self._handle_format_r_adr,
            'ADDA': self._handle_format_r_adr, 'JUMP': self._handle_format_adr,
            'RET': self._handle_no_operand, 'NOP': self._handle_no_operand,
            'DC': self._handle_dc
        }
        
        self.REGISTER_MAP = {f'GR{i}': i for i in range(8)}
```
- **`self.symbol_table = {}`**: An empty dictionary that will store labels as keys and their calculated memory addresses as values. For example: `{'PGM': 0, 'A': 4, 'B': 5, 'C': 6}`.
- **`self.intermediate_representation = []`**: A list that will hold a parsed, structured version of each line of code. It serves as the output of the first pass and the input for the second pass.
- **`self.machine_code = []`**: A list that will store the final, generated hexadecimal machine code strings.
- **`self.OPCODE_MAP`**: A critical lookup table (dictionary) defining the properties of all known instructions. For each mnemonic (e.g., `'LD'`), it stores its hexadecimal operation code (`'10'`) and its length in memory words (`2`). This length is vital for calculating addresses in the first pass.
- **`self.instruction_handlers`**: This dictionary acts as a "dispatcher." It maps an opcode string to the specific function that knows how to generate its machine code. This design makes the code cleaner and easier to extend with new instructions.
- **`self.REGISTER_MAP`**: A simple map to convert register names like `'GR1'` into their numeric equivalent (`1`), which is necessary for constructing the final machine code word.

### `compile(self, source_code)` Method: The Main Controller

This is the main public method used to start the entire compilation process. It orchestrates the two passes in the correct order and includes error handling.

```python
    def compile(self, source_code):
        """
        Orchestrates the two-pass compilation process.
        """
        print("--- Starting Compilation ---")
        try:
            self.first_pass(source_code)
            print("\n--- First Pass Complete ---")
            print("Symbol Table:", self.symbol_table)

            self.second_pass()
            print("\n--- Second Pass Complete ---")
            print("Generated Machine Code:", self.machine_code)

            return self.machine_code
        except (ValueError, NameError) as e:
            print(f"Compilation Error: {e}")
            return None
```
The `try...except` block is a robust way to handle errors. If something goes wrong during compilation (like a duplicate label), it catches the error and prints a friendly message instead of crashing the program.

### `_parse_line(self, line)` Method: The Line Dissector

This is a private helper method that takes a single raw line of text from the source code and breaks it down into its fundamental parts: a label (if any), an opcode, and operands.

```python
    def _parse_line(self, line):
        original_line = line
        line = line.strip()
        if not line or line.startswith(';'):
            return None
        if ';' in line:
            line = line.split(';', 1)[0].strip()

        parts = line.split(None, 1)
        first_word = parts[0]
        label, opcode, operands_str = None, None, ''

        if first_word in self.OPCODE_MAP:
            opcode = first_word
            if len(parts) > 1: operands_str = parts[1]
        else:
            label = first_word
            if len(parts) < 2:
                raise ValueError(f"Labeled line '{label}' is missing its instruction.")
            rest_of_line = parts[1]
            opcode_and_operands = rest_of_line.split(None, 1)
            opcode = opcode_and_operands[0]
            if len(opcode_and_operands) > 1: operands_str = opcode_and_operands[1]

        if opcode not in self.OPCODE_MAP:
            raise ValueError(f"Unknown opcode '{opcode}' on line: '{original_line.strip()}'")

        operands = [op.strip() for op in operands_str.split(',')] if operands_str else []
        return {'label': label, 'opcode': opcode, 'operands': operands}
```
The core logic here determines if a line contains a label:
- If the first word on the line is a known command from `OPCODE_MAP`, there is no label.
- If the first word is *not* a known command, it *must* be a label.
The method returns a neatly structured dictionary (e.g., `{'label': 'A', 'opcode': 'DC', 'operands': ['3']}`), which is much easier for the other methods to process.

### `first_pass(self, source_code)` Method

This method implements the logic for the first pass: building the `symbol_table` and the `intermediate_representation`.

```python
    def first_pass(self, source_code):
        location_counter = 0
        lines = source_code.split('\n')
        
        for line_num, line in enumerate(lines):
            parsed = self._parse_line(line)
            if not parsed: continue

            parsed['address'] = location_counter
            self.intermediate_representation.append(parsed)

            if parsed['label']:
                if parsed['label'] in self.symbol_table:
                    raise NameError(f"Duplicate label definition: '{parsed['label']}'")
                self.symbol_table[parsed["label"]] = location_counter

            opcode = parsed['opcode']
            if opcode in self.OPCODE_MAP:
                if opcode == 'DS':
                    size = int(parsed['operands'][0])
                    location_counter += size
                elif opcode == 'DC':
                    location_counter += len(parsed['operands'])
                else:
                    _, length = self.OPCODE_MAP[opcode]
                    location_counter += length
            elif opcode != 'START' and opcode != 'END':
                raise ValueError(f"Unknown opcode: '{opcode}'")
```
- A `location_counter` variable keeps track of the current memory address.
- For each line, it stores the parsed result along with the current `location_counter` value in the `intermediate_representation`.
- If a label exists, it is added to the `symbol_table` with the current address.
- The `location_counter` is then incremented by the correct amount for the next line, based on the instruction's length found in `OPCODE_MAP` or the value in a directive like `DS`.

### `second_pass(self)` Method

This method uses the data structures built in the first pass to generate the final machine code.

```python
    def second_pass(self):
        self.machine_code = []
        for instruction in self.intermediate_representation:
            opcode = instruction['opcode']

            if opcode in ['START', 'END', 'DS']:
                continue
            
            handler = self.instruction_handlers.get(opcode)
            if handler:
                handler(instruction)
            else:
                print(f"Warning: Second pass handler for opcode '{opcode}' is not yet implemented.")
```
- It iterates through the `intermediate_representation`.
- It skips directives like `START`, `END`, and `DS` that do not generate executable code.
- It uses the `instruction_handlers` dictionary to find and call the correct handler function responsible for translating the current instruction.

### The Handler Methods (`_handle_...`)

These are the specialized, private functions that perform the final translation for different instruction formats.

#### `_handle_format_r_adr` (for `LD GR1, A`)
Handles instructions with a register and a memory address.
```python
    def _handle_format_r_adr(self, instruction):
        op_hex = self.OPCODE_MAP[instruction['opcode']][0]
        r_val = self.REGISTER_MAP[instruction['operands'][0]]
        address = self.symbol_table[instruction['operands'][1]]
        x_val = 0
        
        first_word = f"{op_hex}{r_val}{x_val}"
        second_word = f"{address:04X}"
        self.machine_code.extend([first_word, second_word])
```
- It looks up the opcode (`'10'`), register number (`1`), and the symbol's address from the tables.
- It assembles the final two machine code words. `f"{address:04X}"` formats the address as a 4-digit, zero-padded, uppercase hexadecimal string.

#### `_handle_format_adr` (for `JUMP LOOP`)
Handles instructions with just a memory address.
```python
    def _handle_format_adr(self, instruction):
        op_hex = self.OPCODE_MAP[instruction['opcode']][0]
        address = self.symbol_table[instruction['operands'][0]]
        r_val = 0
        x_val = 0

        first_word = f"{op_hex}{r_val}{x_val}"
        second_word = f"{address:04X}"
        self.machine_code.extend([first_word, second_word])
```
- This is similar to the above, but the register field (`r_val`) is hardcoded to `0` as it's not used in this format.

#### `_handle_no_operand` (for `RET`)
Handles single-word instructions with no operands.
```python
    def _handle_no_operand(self, instruction):
        op_hex = self.OPCODE_MAP[instruction['opcode']][0]
        machine_word = f"{op_hex}00"
        self.machine_code.append(machine_word)
```
- It simply gets the opcode and pads it with `00` since the register and index fields are unused.

#### `_handle_dc` (for `A DC 3`)
Handles the `DC` (Define Constant) directive.
```python
    def _handle_dc(self, instruction):
        for const in instruction['operands']:
            value = int(const)
            machine_word = f"{value:04X}"
            self.machine_code.append(machine_word)
```
- It converts the constant operand (e.g., `'3'`) into an integer and then formats it as a 16-bit (4-digit hex) machine word.

### `if __name__ == "__main__":` Block: The Test Run

This standard Python construct contains code that only runs when the script is executed directly (not when it's imported as a module). It's used here to test the assembler with an example program.

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Example CASL II program for demonstration and testing.
    casl_program = """
    PGM      START
             LD    GR1,A      ; Load value at address A into GR1
             ADDA  GR1,B      ; Add value at address B to GR1
             ST    GR1,C      ; Store the result from GR1 into address C
    A        DC    3          ; Define constant A with value 3
    B        DC    5          ; Define constant B with value 5
    C        DS    1          ; Reserve 1 word of storage for C
             END              ; End of the program
    """
    # 1. Create an instance of our Compiler class.
    compiler = Compiler()
    # 2. Call the main compile method to start the process.
    compiler.compile(casl_program)
```
